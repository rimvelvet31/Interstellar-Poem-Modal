          Do not go gentle into that good night,<br />
          Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br />
          Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br />
          <br />
          Though wise men at their end know dark is right,<br />
          Because their words had forked no lightning they<br />
          Do not go gentle into that good night.<br />
          <br />
          Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright<br />
          Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,<br />
          Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br />
          <br />
          Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,<br />
          And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<br />
          Do not go gentle into that good night.<br />
          <br />
          Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight<br />
          Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,<br />
          Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br />
          <br />
          And you, my father, there on the sad height,<br />
          Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.<br />
          Do not go gentle into that good night.<br />
          Rage, rage against the dying of the light.<br />
